ADD A NEW TRANSLATION STRING AND USE IT
=======================================

1. Add a new string-variable at: translations/en/en_strings.cfg
    such as:
    set str_foo="Fooing"

   Note: Every translation string starts with str as a convention although technically is not a requirement.

2. Repeat the process at: menus/translation/LANG/LANG_strings.cfg
    for other languages.

3. Make sure you export it at: menus/translations_export.cfg file
   such as:
   export str_foo

4. If you want to use the translation script you just have to use it as a normal Grub2 variable.

  As an example from current code:

###
menuentry "$str_detect_any_os" {
 configfile $script_prefix/osdetect.cfg
}
###

$str_detect_any_os is the variable which will be replaced with "Detect any OS" in English language in runtime.
