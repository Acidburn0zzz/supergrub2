This is the Super Grub2 Disk.  Welcome.

This file contains instructions for building and installing the Super Grub Disk.

The Requirements
================

Super Grub Disk depends on some software packages installed into your system. If
you don't have any of them, please obtain and install them before
configuring the Super Grub Disk.

* Debian's GRUB based on upstream GNU GRUB 1.96 (grub-pc package)
* xorriso package or binary

If you happen to have a non-Debian system you have to check for the following files that might or not be inside packages.
The paths to each one of the files being written here are the ones that Super Grub Disk uses.
Currently Super Grub Disk has not a configure step you might want to use symlinks in order to Super Grub Disk find them.

Binaries:
* /usr/bin/grub-mkrescue
* /usr/bin/grub-mkimage
Grub modules:
* /usr/lib/grub/i386-pc

Build Super Grub2 Disk

You should be able to build Super Grub2 Disk from the source code directory with the following command:

./supergrub-mkrescue

It should output a file called: super_grub2_disk_hybrid_<VERSION>.iso

where <VERSION> is the Super Grub2 Disk's version.
