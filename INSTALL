This file contains instructions for building Super GRUB2 Disk.

Requirements
================

Super GRUB2 Disk tends to depend heavily on the latest features of GRUB2, so using it with older versions of GRUB2 is very likely to fail. Currently Super GRUB2 Disk requires GRUB 2.0 (as opposed to GRUB 1.99, which is GRUB2, but is not GRUB 2.0). Newer versions of GRUB2 than 2.0 will probably work with this version of Super GRUB2 Disk's scripts, but I can't make any guarantees about the future. GNU xorriso is also needed (it's a dependency of the grub-mkrescue utility which is part of GRUB2).

Build Super Grub2 Disk
==========================
You should be able to build Super Grub2 Disk from the source code directory with the following command:

./supergrub-mkrescue

It should output a file called: super_grub2_disk_hybrid_<VERSION>.iso

where <VERSION> is the Super Grub2 Disk's version.
