  Translating into your language is quite easy as long as you do not use special characters.
You should replicate translations/en structure the same ways as translations/es structure has
been replicated.

  Supposing that you are translating into french (fr) in the end you should have:
  translations/fr/fr.cfg
  translations/fr/fr.sh

In fr.sh you should change the name for your language and make sure that langcode is the same
you have used for the translation directory and file names.
In fr.cfg you should translate the text enclosed between double quotes.

In order to test your translation please check:
  Build Super Grub2 Disk
section at INSTALL file.
